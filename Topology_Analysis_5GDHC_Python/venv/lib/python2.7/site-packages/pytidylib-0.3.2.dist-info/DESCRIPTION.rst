`PyTidyLib`_ is a Python package that wraps the `HTML Tidy`_ library. This
allows you, from Python code, to "fix" invalid (X)HTML markup. Some of the
library's many capabilities include:

* Clean up unclosed tags and unescaped characters such as ampersands
* Output HTML 4 or XHTML, strict or transitional, and add missing doctypes
* Convert named entities to numeric entities, which can then be used in XML
  documents without an HTML doctype.
* Clean up HTML from programs such as Word (to an extent)
* Indent the output, including proper (i.e. no) indenting for ``pre`` elements,
  which some (X)HTML indenting code overlooks.

Changes
=======

* 0.3.2: Initialization bug fix

* 0.3.1: find_library support while still allowing a list of library names

* 0.3.0: Refactored to use Tidy and PersistentTidy classes while keeping the
functional interface (which will lazily create a global Tidy() object) for
backward compatibility. You can now pass a list of library names and base
options when instantiating Tidy. The keep_doc argument is now deprecated
and does nothing; use PersistentTidy.

* 0.2.4: Bugfix for a strange memory allocation corner case in Tidy.

* 0.2.3: Python 3 support (2 + 3 cross compatible) with passing Tox tests.

Small example of use
====================

The following code cleans up an invalid HTML document and sets an option::

    from tidylib import tidy_document
    document, errors = tidy_document('''<p>f&otilde;o <img src="bar.jpg">''',
      options={'numeric-entities':1})
    print document
    print errors
